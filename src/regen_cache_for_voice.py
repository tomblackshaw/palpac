"""Executable to regenerate the audio cache for text-to-speech.

Created on Aug 19, 2024

@author: Tom Blackshaw

This code takes the list of acceptable names (Charlie, Liam, etc.) â€“ names of
voices available from ElevenLabs, under the user's current subscription - and
generates audio for each of the common phrases. These phrases include greetings,
apologies, hours, minutes, days, etc.

The audio files are saved in ./sounds/cache/{voice name}/

Todo:
    * For module TODOs
    * You have to also use ``sphinx.ext.todo`` extension
