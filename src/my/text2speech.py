Module for interacting with the ElevenLabs text-to-speech API. There is a
lot of cool stuff in here.

Example:
    Here is one::

        $ python3
        >>> from my.text2speech import Text2SpeechSingleton as tts
        >>> s = "Hello there. There's a car in the bar, by the farm."
        >>> tts.say(s)
        >>> for i in range(0,10): tts.name = tts.random_name; audiodata = tts.audio(s); tts.play(audiodata)

Section breaks are created by resuming unindented text. Section breaks
are also implicitly created anytime a new section starts.

Attributes:
    Text2SpeechSingleton (_Text2SpeechClass): The singleton
